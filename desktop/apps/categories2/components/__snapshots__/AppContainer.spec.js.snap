        The Art Genome Project
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Art Genome Project is the classification system and technological framework that powers Artsy.
      </p>
      <p>
        It maps the characteristics (we call them “genes”) that connect artists, artworks, architecture, and design objects across history.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are currently over 1,000 characteristics in The Art Genome Project, including art historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities.
